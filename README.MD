**This server has rules. Read them:** https://github.com/XanTheDragon/OriDiscordMCStuff/blob/master/RULES.MD <br/>
n.b. if you are using this and you don't plan on doing anything with the official server (which as of writing isn't even up) you can skip this step.

# Setting Up
## Big Step 1: Java
If you don't have it installed already, install Java. You can get Java [HERE (click here)](https://java.com/en/download/win10.jsp) if you don't have it.

## Big Step 2: Minecraft Forge
You need Minecraft Forge 1.12.2 for this to work.

**Step 1:** Launch Minecraft 1.12.2 at least once (so that a 1.12.2 version is created in your game directory).

**Step 2:** Download the Forge installer for 1.12.2 (which you can get [HERE (click here)](https://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/1.12.2-14.23.5.2847/forge-1.12.2-14.23.5.2847-installer.jar)). **Run this with Java** (Do *NOT* open with WinRAR / 7zip!), and select *Install Client* (not Server or Extract) and click OK. Wait for it to finish, then move on when it says it's done.

## Big Step 3: The Mods

**Step 1:** Go to your Minecraft install folder (usually `%appdata%\.minecraft`). Keep this folder open, as you will need it regardless of which way you decide to do this.

You need the official mods to join this server.

### Step 3-A: Automatic Downloader (easy way)
If you don't trust yourself with downloading mods, I have written an EXE file that will do it for you.

You can download that EXE from the releases tab, or [HERE (click here)](https://github.com/XanTheDragon/OriDiscordMCStuff/releases/download/1b/MCAutoDownloader.exe). **Put this EXE into the .minecraft folder.**

### Step 3-B: Manual Install

The link to all of the mods and configuration files: [HERE (click here)](https://github.com/XanTheDragon/OriDiscordMCStuff/releases/download/1/ORI_SERVER_MODS_AND_CONFIG.zip).

**Step 1:** Download + open the ZIP file from the line just above. You will see two folders inside: `config` and `mods`.

**Step 2:** Go to your Minecraft install folder (usually `%appdata%\.minecraft`). Drag both of the folders from the .zip file into the `.minecraft` folder. *If a `mods` folder already exists, make sure it is empty, or just rename it (e.g. to `mods-old`) if you had mods you want to keep already.*

**Step 3:** If any files prompt you to replace them, replace the files. This should probably not be the case, but it might happen if you've already modded Minecraft.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** If you already installed mods from this server and you are installing new mods, **MAKE SURE YOU DELETE THE OLD ONES FIRST.** I may change versions of mods at any time an you might end up having duplicate mods. All .jar files for mods should be in `mods\1.12.2` (not in the main `mods` folder, but instead the folder named `1.12.2` that's *inside* of the mods folder.)

# Congratulations! You're done!
After you've finished the steps above, you should be able to join the server.

When you enter the game, you will spawn in a dark box with a pressure plate at the bottom. If this pressure plate doesn't trip (teleporting you to the surface), try jumping a few times.

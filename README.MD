# Eti's Modded Minecraft Server for the Ori the Game Discord


# Setting Up
## Big Step 1: Java
If you don't have it installed already, install Java. You can get Java [HERE (click here)](https://java.com/en/download/win10.jsp) if you don't have it.

## Big Step 2: Minecraft Forge
You need Minecraft Forge 1.12.2 for this to work.

**Step 1:** Launch Minecraft 1.12.2 at least once (so that a 1.12.2 version is created in your game directory).

**Step 2:** Download the Forge installer for 1.12.2 (which you can get [HERE (click here)](https://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/1.12.2-14.23.5.2768/forge-1.12.2-14.23.5.2768-installer.jar)). **Run this with Java** (Do *NOT* open with WinRAR / 7zip!), and select *Client* (not Server or SDK) and click install. Wait for it to finish, then move on when it says it's done.

## Big Step 3: The Mods
You need mods to join this server. The mods are on this repository, but for ease of access, a link to all of the mods is [HERE (click here)](https://github.com/XanTheDragon/OriDiscordMCStuff/releases/download/1/ORI_SERVER_MODS_AND_CONFIG.zip).

**Step 1:** Download + open the ZIP file from the line just above. You will see two folders inside: `config` and `mods`.

**Step 2:** Go to your Minecraft install folder (usually `%appdata%\.minecraft`). Drag both of the folders from the .zip file into the `.minecraft` folder. *If a `mods` folder already exists, make sure it is empty, or just rename it (e.g. to `mods-old`) if you had mods you want to keep already.*

**Step 3:** If any files prompt you to replace them, replace the files. This should probably not be the case, but it might happen if you've already modded Minecraft.

# Congratulations! You're done!
After you've finished the steps above, you should be able to join the server.

When you enter the portal, you will spawn in a dark box with a pressure plate at the bottom. If this pressure plate doesn't trip (teleporting you to a much brighter room), try jumping a few times.

# Info

## Gamerules & Mechanics
When playing this server, several rules are set:
- Spirits have only 5 hearts.
- PvP is OFF
- Fire ticking is OFF (no spread, but also no automatic extinguishing except for in rain)
- Mob Griefing is OFF
- Keep Inventory is TRUE
- Difficulty is EASY
- Betweenlands Decay is ON (You must collect sap from sap-bearing trees (you'll know it when you see it, it has orange blobs all over the wood texture and there's a specific tree just for it)). This may change depending on user request.

## Other Necessities
- You can use `/name yourNameHere` to set a custom name via MorePlayerModels. Please use this sparingly. This is only to appeal to the RP community, assuming it grows here.

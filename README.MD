**This server has rules. Read them.**

# Important Note: Optifine Compatibility
- This pack is NOT guaranteed to work 100% with Optifine. Any crashes you have while using Optifine will be *ignored*. Use Optifine at your own risk! **Testing has been briefly done with [THIS VERSION (click here to download)](https://optifine.net/adloadx?f=OptiFine_1.12.2_HD_U_F5.jar)**

# Setting Up
## Big Step 1: Java
If you don't have it installed already, install Java. You can get Java [HERE (click here)](https://java.com/en/download/win10.jsp) if you don't have it.

## Big Step 2: Minecraft Forge
You need Minecraft Forge 1.12.2 for this to work.

**Step 1:** Launch Minecraft 1.12.2 at least once (so that a 1.12.2 version is created in your game directory).

**Step 2:** Download the Forge installer for 1.12.2 (which you can get [HERE (click here)](https://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/1.12.2-14.23.5.2847/forge-1.12.2-14.23.5.2847-installer.jar)). **Run this with Java** (Do *NOT* open with WinRAR / 7zip!), and select *Install Client* (not Server or Extract) and click OK. Wait for it to finish, then move on when it says it's done.

## Big Step 3: The Mods
You need mods to join this server. The mods are on this repository, but for ease of access, a link to all of the mods is [HERE (click here)](https://github.com/XanTheDragon/OriDiscordMCStuff/releases/download/1/ORI_SERVER_MODS_AND_CONFIG.zip).

**Step 1:** Download + open the ZIP file from the line just above. You will see two folders inside: `config` and `mods`.

**Step 2:** Go to your Minecraft install folder (usually `%appdata%\.minecraft`). Drag both of the folders from the .zip file into the `.minecraft` folder. *If a `mods` folder already exists, make sure it is empty, or just rename it (e.g. to `mods-old`) if you had mods you want to keep already.*

**Step 3:** If any files prompt you to replace them, replace the files. This should probably not be the case, but it might happen if you've already modded Minecraft.

# Congratulations! You're done!
After you've finished the steps above, you should be able to join the server.

When you enter the portal, you will spawn in a dark box with a pressure plate at the bottom. If this pressure plate doesn't trip (teleporting you to a much brighter room), try jumping a few times.

# Info

## Known Bugs
- At times you may randomly die out of nowhere. If this happens, **click respawn, then re-log from the server.** This is a desync issue. You aren't actually dead, but if you don't click respawn and log back in, the server will think you're dead and you won't be able to do anything.

## Gamerules & Mechanics
When playing this server, several rules are set:
- Spirits have only 5 hearts.
- PvP is OFF
- Fire ticking is OFF (no spread, but also no automatic extinguishing except for in rain)
- Mob Griefing is OFF
- Keep Inventory is TRUE
- Difficulty is EASY
- Betweenlands Decay is ON (You must collect sap from sap-bearing trees (you'll know it when you see it, it has orange blobs all over the wood texture and there's a specific tree just for it)). This may change depending on user request.
- Betweenlands Corrosion is OFF (This mechanic causes your tools to slowly decay in the world unless you apply scabyst ore to it. This mechanic is designed to keep you on your toes and is not necessary for good gameplay)

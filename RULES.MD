# Server Rules

- **All rules of the Ori the Game Discord Server apply here.**
- **I reserve the right to restrict or grant bonus perms to anyone at any time for any reason.** It's my server, I make the rules.
- **Be respectful.** Mind your own business on the place. If people don't want you in their house or building close to them, be respectful and go somewhere else. It goes the other way too -- Don't be over the top and make sure nobody does anything within some absurd distance of you. If you want to be secluded, then spend the time to go out somewhere far or ask me to teleport you away by 1K blocks or something.
- **Do not interfere with others' items or builds.** If you steal someone's stuff, you'll be kicked/banned and the items will be forcefully restored to the owner's inventory. If you grief someone's designs, the changes will be reverted and you will be permabanned.

# Getting Started

## Part 1: Movement Basics
- As a Spirit, you are immune to fall damage and will always have Speed II + Jump Boost II.
- While against a wall and *not* on the ground, tap shift to wall jump. Hold shift to grip to the wall.
- You can double jump
- You can fit in 1-block-tall spaces. Use this to your advantage! Some of the mobs in The Betweenlands are incredibly dangerous.

## Part 2: The Betweenlands

### Decay
The Betweenlands are locked in a state constant decay, you and your tools included. Above your hunger bar you will see brown orbs. These orbs represent your own integrity. The less orbs you have, the more decayed you are. At certain points of decay you will begin to notice fungus and other yucky stuff growing off of your hand (it also applies to the charactermodel, but the spirit model is not compatible). **You will also lose max health as you decay, and progressively get slower.** You will *not* die if you become fully decayed, but you are incredibly weak.

Locate Sap Trees and break their logs to get Sap. Eating this Sap will restore your protection from the decay. The item looks the same as the picture for the decay bar.

### Materials
In The Betweenlands, there are several available ores. In order of strength:
1) Weedwood // **(Do NOT use cragrock/betweenstone! Stone tools don't work here! Go straight to bones.)**
2) Slimy Bones, which generate like an ore in the ground and are also dropped by swamp hags.
3) Syrmorite, which is a blue ore that looks sort of like lapis ore as a block.
4) Octine, which is a firey orange ore that glows in the dark.
5) Valonite, which is a very rare pearly white ore in the deepest darkest depths of the world.
--
1) Sulfur, which is basically Coal for The Betweenlands.
2) Scabyst, which is used to counter decay of tools (see below)

Tools are also subject to the world's decay. When you mouse over one of your tools, you will see a status message ("Good as new!") with a number, usually 0/250. As this number increases, your tool becomes more decayed and weaker. At 250, it will break regardless of what durability is remaining. This can be resolved by mining Scabyst Ore and crafting the tool + the ore together to add a **coating**.

### Monsters
There are some monsters that are incredibly dangerous in the betweenlands, especially to spirits. In order from most threatening to least threatening hostile mobs:

#### Wights
Wights are tall white ghosts that ripple the world around them. They are capable of rolling out unfathomably high amounts of damage and if you are not equipped for combat, you will likely die.

#### Peat Mummies
The Swamp Hag's Chad counterpart, Peat Mummies have **110 HP** (just over half of the enderdragon!) and deal absurd amounts of damage. They only spawn by random chance (rarely) if you walk over Peat, a block type. You will know if they spawn as they will begin to dig out of the ground. If this happens and you are not equipped, run and *do not stop running*.

#### Chiromaws & Swamp Hags
Chiromaws are basically giant bats (about as big as a chicken) that lurk in caves.

Swamp hags are decayed and long-lost men, driven mad by their state. They have a *large* health pool and hit hard.

#### Boulder Sprites
Prepare to get the shit scared out of you. These boulders lurk in caves and roll at you when you least expect it. They are mainly annoying for the jumpscare they tend to give, but are otherwise not too problematic.

#### Many More!
